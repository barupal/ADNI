Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative: Untargeted Lipidomics Analysis

### This project has two sub-projects. 
1) Generation of a untargeted lipidomics dataset from ~ 800 serum samples analyzed using a Agilent UPLC QTOF mass spectrometer. 
2) Identification of lipid coregulatory modules associated with Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, endophenotypes and CSF biomarkers.
