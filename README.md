Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative: Untargeted Lipidomics Analysis

### This project has two sub-projects. 
1) Generation of a untargeted lipidomics dataset from ~ 800 serum samples analyzed using a Agilent UPLC QTOF mass spectrometer. 
Generation and quality control of lipidomics data for the alzheimerâ€™s disease neuroimaging initiative cohort (https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2018263)
2) Identification of lipid coregulatory modules associated with Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, endophenotypes and CSF biomarkers.
